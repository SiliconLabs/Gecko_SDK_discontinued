WARNING:

Do not attach or use headphones with this example. Use small
loadspeakers with built in amplification, ensuring volume is at an
acceptable level. Exposure to loud noises from any source for extended
periods of time may temporarily or permanently affect your hearing. The
louder the volume sound level, the less time is required before your
hearing could be affected. Hearing damage from loud noise is sometimes
undetectable at first and can have a cumulative effect.
