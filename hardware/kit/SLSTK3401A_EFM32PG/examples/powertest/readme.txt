Power test example, running demonstration of energy modes.

This example project use EFM32 CMSIS and the emlib peripheral library
to demonstrate the use of the various Energy Modes available on the
EFM32PG1B200F256. When running this example, the Energy Profiler tool
in Simplicity Studio can be used to show the power consumption of each
energy mode.
