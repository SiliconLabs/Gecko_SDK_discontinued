Power test example, running demonstration of energy modes.

This example project use EFM32 CMSIS and the emlib peripheral library 
to demonstrate the use of the various Energy Modes available on the
EFM32G890F128. When running this example, the EnergyAware Profiler tool
in Simplicity Studio can be used to show the power consumption of each 
energy mode.
