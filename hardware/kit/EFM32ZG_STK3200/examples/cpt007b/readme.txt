CPT007B Demo

This demo demonstrates the capacitive button function of CPT007B fixed function
board. This demo runs on the EFM32 STK, and communicates with CPT007B through
the GPIO pins on the EXP header. Virtual buttons on STK's LCD screen indicate
whether the capacitive sensing buttons on CPT007B are pressed or released.
This demo supports up to 7 capacitive buttons on CPT007B
