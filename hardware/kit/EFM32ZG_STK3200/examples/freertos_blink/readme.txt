FreeRTOS - Blink example

This example project uses the FreeRTOS, and gives a basic demonstration of using two tasks to blink the LEDs on the board. 
It also shows how to use idle mode with different energy saving modes ( from EM1 to EM2 - configured in FreeRTOSConfig.h file).
This example is intended as a skeleton for new projects using FreeRTOS.
