UART output on RS232 port A.

This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS and emlib including
the DVK BSP (board support package) and demonstrates the use of
USART communication on the EFM32 GK Development Kit, serial port A.

USART1 is used, GPIO port C pins 0 and 1, baudrate 115200-8-N-1.

It sets up access to DVK registers, for use with MCU-Module's
with and without LCD.
