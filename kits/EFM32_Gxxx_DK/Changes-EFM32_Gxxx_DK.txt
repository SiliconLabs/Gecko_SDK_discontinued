  also clear USART_ROUTE register to not drive GPIO pins after the call.
  This means USART_ROUTE can not be called _before_ calls to USART_InitSync()/
  USART_InitASync()

1.6.1:
- This release requires the EFM32_CMSIS_2.0.x package
- Updates to make microsd driver more robust (wavplayer and slideshow examples)

- Moved LCD font definition into C file, added extern declarations to header
- Added const to LCD structures, to make sure arrays go into flash storage

1.6.0:
- EFM32_CMSIS_1.3.0 required for this release
- Updated examples to comply with latest EFM32_CMSIS updates
- CHIP_init (drivers/chip.h) has been moved to EFM32_CMSIS efm32_chip.h,
  and renamed CHIP_Init to comply with efm32lib conventions
- Updated and corrected all project files; some project options were not
  correctly defined for various IDEs
- Added debug and release builds in CodeSourcery makefiles
- Added IrDA example
- Added MPU example
- Added Micrium uC/OS-II example project (IAR EWARM and Keil MDKARM only)
- Added inttemp - internal temperature sensor example for EFM32 revC chips
- Added wav_player example - plays .WAV file from micro-SD card
- Corrected segmentlcd driver, LCD_SEGMENT_DP<x> had wrong defines

1.5.1:
- Rowley CrossWorks project files changed, file paths are now compatible
  with non-windows environments

1.5.0:
- EFM32_CMSIS_1.2.0 required for this release
- Updated board (DVK) specific drivers to use new efm32lib Peripheral APIs
- Added even simpler energy mode demo, called "emode", use EFM joystick
  to control application
- Fixed some problems in SegmentLCD (previously lcdcontroller), which now
  will correctly disable display (fixes segment junk and reduces current)
- Added slideshow demo with FatFS on microSD support, read readme.txt for
  details
- graphics library and FatFS now in drivers directory
- RTC and LCD controller now use LFRCO instead of LFXO

1.4.2:
- Fixed iar project files
- Fixed build of G290 variant of several examples, removed double file
  entries in project files

1.4.0:
- Added SPI support for driving TFT-LCD. Currently very slow in SPI-mode.
- New examples require EFM32_CMSIS_1.1.3
- New potentiometer, light sensor, preamp and accelometer examples

1.3.4:
- Fixed double entries in project files

1.3.3:
- Moved several duplicated drivers, such as lcdcontroller, into drivers folder
- Added temperature and eeprom examples
- Updated BSP - DVK_getJoystick and DVK_getPushbutton will now only return
  events when AEM-state indicates EFM32 (Keys: EFM in GUI)
- Added project files for CrossWorks and Codesourcery Makefiles
- Moved common peripheral code into drivers subdirectory
- Changed several examples to use efm32lib
- BSP now requires EFM32_CMSIS_1.1.2 or higher
- Minor clean ups and fixes to all examples

1.2.0:
- Added new example, "clocks"
- EFM32_CMSIS_1.0.5 (or higher) required for this release
- Updated example applications to refelect new EFM32_CMSIS update
- Updated chip errata code, clock disable was introduced in test rev > 3
- Added voltage check to enable VBOOST when necessary on LCD

1.1.1:
- Examples using FPGA interrupts changed GPIO configuration to use pull up
  due to changes in DVK kit FPGA firmware

1.1.0:
- Minor, cosmetic changes, integration release with EFM32_CMSIS_1.0.4
- Added missing files to G290 variant of rs232a example

1.0.6:

- Added RS232 port A, USART example (115200 baud) similar to rs232b example
- Chip errata in zip file

1.0.5:
- Internal only, not released

1.0.4:
- Bug fixes for some examples, if EFM32 goes down to EM4, need to clear FPGA
  interrupt on restart (for joystick and emlcd examples), cmu->syncbusy issue
  fixed with leuart example

1.0.3:
- Updated to use latest EFM32_CMSIS version 1.0.3, some bit field changes
  to LCD examples
- Added chip errata calibration fix, updated all example projects with fix
- NOTE! Example projects changed to reflect chip errata fixes, now default is
  is all peripheral clocks off

1.0.2:
- Updated lcd example: Turned off clocks/peripherals that were not active
  during demonstration
- Updated emlcd rtc, ensure right clock was selected and enabled
- Updated BSP, disable USART2 SPI clocks in DVK_disable()

1.0.1:
- First public release
- Corrected several BSP issues, added functional EBI access

1.0.0:
