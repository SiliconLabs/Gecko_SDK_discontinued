This demo demonstrates key features of the TouchGFX framework such as full
screen transitions, drag and drop, animations, and swipe gestures. The 
MCU load is presented in the upper right corner throughout the demo. 

The high performance and low MCU load are achieved by the advanced
rendering algorithms of TouchGFX and by utilizing advanced DMA features included in 
the EFM32GG.

The button labeled PB1 can be used to toggle the hardware masking and alpha-blending
features that are unique to the EFM32 processor. Notice the increase in MCU load 
especially during screen transitions with these features disabled. TouchGFX is 
currently the only graphics framework on the market that utilizes these features.
