FreeRTOS - Blink example

This example project uses the FreeRTOS, and gives a basic demonstration of using two tasks to blink the LEDs on the board. 
It also shows how to use idle with different energy saving modes with or without ticless mode( from EM1 to EM3 - configured in FreeRTOSConfig.h file).
This example is intended as a skeleton for new projects using FreeRTOS.
