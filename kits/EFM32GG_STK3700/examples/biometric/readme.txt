Biometric Demo using the Biometric Sensor add-on board on the EFM32GG-STK3700.

This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS including emlib and the
board support package support functions/drivers to demonstrate driving
the LCD display on the EFM32GG_STK3700 kit. In addition, it
demonstrates the use of Silicon Labs I2C based sensors on the expansion board
header.

You must have a Silicon Labs Biometric Sensor add-on board to make use of this demo.
