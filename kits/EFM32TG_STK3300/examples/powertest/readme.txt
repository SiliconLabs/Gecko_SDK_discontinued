Power test example, running demonstration of energy modes.

This example project use EFM32 CMSIS and the emlib peripheral library
to demonstrate the use of the various Energy Modes available on the
EFM32G890F128.  When running this example, the EnergyAware Profiler tool
in Simplicity Studio can show the power consumption of each enery mode.
