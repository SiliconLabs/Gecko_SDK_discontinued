Select a single energy mode, and stay there.

This example project uses the EFM32 CMSIS and demonstrates the use of the LCD 
controller, RTC (real time counter), GPIO and various Energy Modes (EM).

The user can press the pushbuttons PB0 and PB1 to select which energy mode to 
demonstrate.

This demo application has been made to give a quick demo of the energyAware 
Profiler from Silicon Labs, including EFM32 energy modes.
