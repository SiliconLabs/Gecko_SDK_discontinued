  isc=bootloader-storage-spiflash-single/bootloader-storage-spiflash-single.isc
  architecture=efr32~series[1],efm32~series[1]
  Application Bootloader for all Wireless protocol stacks, using an external
  SPI flash to store upgrade images received OTA by the application. This sample configuration supports storing a single firmware update image at a time, and
  is plug-and-play compatible with the default configuration of the OTA Client
  in Zigbee sample applications.

  dir=bootloader-storage-internal/
  isc=bootloader-storage-internal/bootloader-storage-internal.isc
  architecture=efr32~series[1],efm32~series[1]
  Application Bootloader for all Wireless protocol stacks, using internal
  flash to store upgrade images received OTA by the application. This sample
  configuration supports storing multiple firmware update images simultaneously
  by configuring multiple storage slots. The storage layout is designed for
  1024 kB EFR32xG12 devices, and the layout of the storage should be modified
  before being run on other devices.

  Application Bootloader for all Wireless protocol stacks, using internal
  flash to store upgrade images received OTA by the application. This sample
  configuration supports storing a single firmware update image at a time, and
  is plug-and-play compatible with the "Local Storage Bootloader" configuration
  of EmberZNet, Silicon Labs Thread and Flex sample applications on 1024 kB
  EFR32xG12 devices. The layout of the storage should be modified before being
  run on other devices.
