/** @brief The Simulated EEPROM callback function, implemented by the
 * application.
 *
 * @param status  An ::EmberStatus error code indicating one of the conditions
 * described below.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN whenever a token is set and a page needs
 * to be erased.  If the main application loop does not periodically
 * call halSimEepromErasePage(), it is best to then erase a page in
 * response to ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_RED
 * when the pages <i>must</i> be erased to prevent data loss.
 * halSimEepromErasePage() needs to be called until it returns 0 to indicate
 * there are no more pages that need to be erased.  Ignoring
 * this indication and not erasing the pages will cause dropping the new data
 * trying to be written.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_FULL when
 * the new data cannot be written due to unerased pages.  <b>Not erasing
 * pages regularly, not erasing in response to
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN, or not erasing in response to
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_RED will cause
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_FULL and the new data will be lost!.</b>  Any future
 * write attempts will be lost as well.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_REPAIRING
 * when the Simulated EEPROM needs to repair itself.  While there's nothing
 * for an app to do when the SimEE is going to repair itself (SimEE has to
 * be fully functional for the rest of the system to work), alert the
 * application to the fact that repairing is occuring.  There are debugging
 * scenarios where an app might want to know that repairing is happening;
 * such as monitoring frequency.
 * @note  Common situations will trigger an expected repair, such as using
 *        a new chip or changing token definitions.
 *
 * If the callback ever reports the status ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_WRITE_INHIBITED or
 * ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_VERIFY_FAILED, this indicates a catastrophic failure in
 * flash writing, meaning either the address being written is not empty or the
 * write itself has failed.  If ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_WRITE_INHIBITED is
 * encountered, the function ::halInternalSimEeRepair(false) should be called
 * and the chip should then be reset to allow proper initialization to recover.
 * If ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_VERIFY_FAILED is encountered the Simulated EEPROM (and
 * tokens) on the specific chip with this error should not be trusted anymore.
 *
