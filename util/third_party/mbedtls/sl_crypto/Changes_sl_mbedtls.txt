================ Revision history ============================================
4.3.0:
 - Updated to mbedtls-2.2.0 including EC JPAKE support.
 - sl_aes.c:
   In mbedtls_aes_setkey_enc and mbedtls_aes_setkey_dec change return value to
   MBEDTLS_ERR_AES_INVALID_KEY_LENGTH when key length is not 128 or 256 bits.
   In mbedtls_aes_crypt_cfb128 added support for data lengths not dividable
   with 16 (AES block size), by using software (no crypto) implementation.
   In mbedtls_aes_crypt_cfb8 return errors from mbedtls_aes_crypt_ecb.
 - library/bignum.c:
   In mbedtls_mpi_sub_abs and mbedtls_mpi_mul_mpi copy to and use local
   variables only if necessary.
 - library/ecp.c:
   In ecp_modp call halResetWatchdog #ifdef MBEDTLS_HAVE_HAL_WATCHDOG_TIMER
   for Thread stack integration.
 - library/aes.c:
   In mbedtls_aes_self_test allow failure when setting 192 bit keys which is
   not supported by CRYPTO.
 - library/gcm.c:
   In mbedtls_gcm_self_test allow failure when setting 192 bit keys which is
   not supported by CRYPTO.
 - library/x509.c and x509_crt.c:
   Excluded code when MBEDTLS_FS_IO is defined which is not supported on
   Silicon Labs devices.
 - Added sl_timing.c and timing_alt.h in order to compiler modules depending on
   MBEDTLS_TIMING_C. The user should #define MBEDTLS_TIMING_ALT in order to
   compile.
 
4.2.1:
 - No changes.

4.2.0:
 - First version including support for mbedtls 2.0.0 and CRYPTO acceleration of
   AES (sl_aes.c), ECC (sl_ecp.c), SHA1 (sl_sha1.c) and SHA256 (sl_sha256.c).
