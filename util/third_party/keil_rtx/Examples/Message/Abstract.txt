This example program shows how to use the RTX Kernel messages
for task inter-communication. Because the message objects in this
example are fixed size, the RTX Thread-Safe Fixed-Block Memory
Allocation functions are used. They are fully reentrant and can
be used with RTX Kernel with no restrictions.

The MESSAGE example program is available for one target:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
