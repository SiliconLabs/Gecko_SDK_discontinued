This is a simple RTX Kernel based example that uses a binary semaphore
to share the communication line. Two threads are defined:

thread1: A thread with high priority, that is executed every 3ms, and
         sends a short string "Thread1" via COM Port. When a 3ms delay
         has expired, it waits for a free semaphore for 1ms.
         If the semaphore is not free it will not send the string.

thread2: A thread with normal priority, running whenever no other thread
         with higher priority is active. It sends a short string "Thread2" 
         via COM Port when the semaphore is free. If the semaphore is 
         in use, it will wait. 

The Semaphore example program is available for one target:

Simulator: uVision Simulator for evaluation
